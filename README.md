# Bank Mail
Bank Mail allows a banking employee to exchange emails with their clients, allowing them to send and receive emails, manage the entire customer list (add, remove and edit the client list) as well as search for emails by various parameters; the employee can add, remove, edit and search tasks so that he can always keep things up to date.
